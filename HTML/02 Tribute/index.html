        <h2>Here's a time line of his life...</h2>
        <p>
          Abdul Qadeer Khan was a Pakistani nuclear physicist and metallurgical
          engineer. He is colloquially known as the "father of Pakistan's atomic
          weapons program". In August 2021, Khan was admitted to Khan Research
          Laboratories Hospital after testing positive for COVID-19. Khan died
          on 10 October 2021, at the age of 85, after being transferred to a
          hospital in Islamabad with lung problems. He was given a state funeral
          at the Faisal Mosque before being buried at the H-8 graveyard in
          Islamabad.
